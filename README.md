  alt="geiger triaging an AWS key — HIGH: prod account with secrets-manager access">

Your secret scanner found the key — it won't tell you if it's still live or what it
unlocks. `geiger` does: pipe any credential-bearing text at it and it recognizes the
credentials inside, runs **read-only** recon with each, and ranks what they actually
reach by blast radius.

Dual-use triage: an incident responder's *"how bad is this?"* and a pentester's
*"what does this key reach?"*. Read-only by construction, dry-run by default.

## Install

**Binary** — grab the archive for your OS/arch from [Releases](../../releases):

```sh
tar xzf geiger_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz && sudo mv geiger /usr/local/bin/
```

**Source** (Go 1.25+):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/puck-security/geiger && cd geiger
go build -o geiger ./cmd/geiger
```

## Tutorial

geiger doesn't touch anything on the network until you say so. Dry-run first
(default): it recognizes the credential and prints the read-only calls it *would*
make. Try it on AWS's well-known example keys — no real secret needed:

```sh
printf 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n' | geiger
```

That prints the read-only calls it *would* run (`sts:GetCallerIdentity`, …). Add
`--live` with a real credential to actually run them and get the impact note:

```sh
echo 'GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...' | geiger --live
```

---

## How-to

```sh
# a file, stdin, or a cloud CLI's output
geiger --live .env
cat sso-cache.json | geiger --live
aws configure export-credentials | geiger --live

# the current environment
geiger --env --live

# this box's own cloud identity — harvest the instance-metadata credential
# (AWS instance role, GCP/Azure managed identity, k8s in-cluster SA, …) and
# triage what it reaches. The post-exploitation question, answered read-only.
geiger --metadata --live
geiger --metadata --live --intrusive   # + in-cluster k8s RBAC, secrets-store drain

# a whole repo / dir (walked; results sorted by impact)
geiger --live ./leaked-repo

# a scanner's report — e.g. a TruffleHog sweep of a compromised laptop,
# exactly what supply-chain worms (Shai-Hulud) run; triage which creds reach prod
geiger --live --from-trufflehog trufflehog.json
geiger --live --from-gitleaks gitleaks-report.json

# external recon: pipe a nuclei exposure scan straight in. Its templates pull the
# leaked value out of each exposed endpoint (/.env, phpinfo, instance metadata);
# geiger types, validates, and ranks it, and records the URL it leaked from. It
# also parses the response body when present, reassembling multi-field creds (an
# AWS key+secret pair, a connection string) the flat extracted-results can't —
# run nuclei with -irr to include the body.
# Stream over a pipe so live secrets never land on disk (add -o only if you must).
nuclei -t exposures/ -l targets.txt -j -irr | geiger --live --from-nuclei -

# rank by YOUR crown jewels (boost anything touching these to HIGH+)
geiger --live --context '1234567890,acme-prod,billing-service' ./repo

# self-hosted services need a host
echo 'VAULT_TOKEN=hvs....' | geiger --live --endpoint https://vault.internal:8200

# only what matters; save a clean artifact
geiger --live --min-severity high -o case-1234.txt ./repo

# OPSEC: identity call only; route egress through a proxy
geiger --live --min-footprint --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 .env

# machine-readable
geiger --live --json ./repo | jq .
```

**Go deeper — `--intrusive`** (doesn't modify resources, but leaves a trail):
connects to databases (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQL Server, Oracle,
ClickHouse, Cassandra — fixed catalog queries, read-only session), reads local
SQLite/IDE stores in place, hits cluster APIs, **redeems cached user refresh
tokens** (Azure / GCP sessions) to map their reach — an active sign-in that shows
in the tenant's audit log — and **follows secrets-store reads**, draining
Vault/Doppler/1Password/cloud secret managers (AWS SM, GCP SM, Azure Key Vault) and
recursively triaging each extracted secret. The same fan-out a worm performs, so
you see the *real* blast radius. Plain `--live` stays read-only: it uses a still-valid
cached token but never redeems a refresh token.

```sh
geiger --live --intrusive .env
```

**SSH keys** — point it at a directory; it fingerprints each key (encrypted keys
are *locked*, not dead). With `--live` it confirms the key's main use — git access
— by attempting an SSH login to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and reporting the account
it authenticates as (or the repo, for a deploy key); a user key that logs in means
pull/push to that account's private repos (supply-chain risk). `--ssh-correlate`
adds candidate target hosts from `~/.ssh/config`, `known_hosts`, and shell history.

```sh
geiger --live ~/.ssh            # fingerprint + test GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket access
geiger --ssh-correlate ~/.ssh   # + guess other target hosts from local hints
```

**Browser extensions** — `--browser` models the impact of a malicious Chromium-family
(Chrome, Edge, Brave, Chromium, Vivaldi) extension (CursedChrome-style proxy, infostealer, sideloaded MV3). It scores each
installed extension's permission union — `cookies` + broad host access + request
interception / script injection / proxy = read every site's session cookies and
pivot through the browser — and flags sideloaded/unpacked ones (unsigned, not
content-verified). With `--live --intrusive` it also inventories the live sessions
such an extension would reach from the Cookies store *metadata* (domains only — the
values are keychain-encrypted), ranked by blast radius (IdP/SSO sessions first).

Because an unsigned all-sites extension is capability-identical to a real
CursedChrome, geiger doesn't guess intent — for each flagged sideloaded extension
it builds a **responder triage bundle**: install age, UI surface, dev-project
markers, the extension id, and a low-false-positive grep of its on-disk code (and,
under `--intrusive`, its LevelDB storage) for hardcoded remote hosts (websocket /
public-IP endpoints) to **verify against egress/DNS logs**. Everything is emitted
as clean IOCs in `--json` (`detail` arrays) for a SIEM.

By default only extensions with risky reach are shown; narrow/benign ones are
collapsed into a count. `--all` lists every installed extension (a full inventory).

```sh
geiger --browser                    # score extensions + triage bundle
geiger --browser --live --intrusive # + session inventory + storage IOC grep
geiger --browser --all              # full inventory (incl. narrow/benign)
geiger --browser --json             # IOCs (extension id, hosts) for a SIEM
```

## Where geiger fits

geiger is not a scanner — it starts where they stop. Detection finds the secret;
geiger triages it. Point gitleaks or TruffleHog at the haystack, or nuclei at
internet-exposed endpoints, then pipe the report in (`--from-gitleaks` /
`--from-trufflehog` / `--from-nuclei -`) to learn which hits actually reach prod.

| | gitleaks | TruffleHog | GitGuardian | **geiger** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Find secrets in code / git / files | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ▶ consumes their report |
| Verify the secret is live | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Characterize blast radius (identity, scope, reach) | — | partial¹ | partial² | ✅ ~163 types, scored |
| Drain secret-managers + recursively triage downstream | — | — | — | ✅ |
| DB / cluster / on-disk store recon (read-only) | — | — | — | ✅ |
| Ranked for IR ("how bad, in what order") | — | — | partial | ✅ |
| Local, no SaaS / account | ✅ | ✅ | — (SaaS) | ✅ |

¹ TruffleHog's `analyze` enumerates permissions for ~a dozen providers — the closest
peer; geiger generalizes that to ~166 credential types with blast-radius scoring and
downstream harvest. ² GitGuardian assigns validity/severity inside its platform.

Detection is their job and they're good at it — geiger doesn't replace them, it
answers the question they leave open: *now that you found it, how bad is it?*

## Reference

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(stdin / files / dirs)* | input source; multiple files/dirs may be passed, and a directory is walked |
| `--live` | make read-only recon calls (default: dry-run) |
| `--intrusive` | connect to DBs / cluster APIs, read local stores, harvest downstream secrets (needs `--live`) |
| `--min-footprint` | identity call only; skip inventory fan-out |
| `--env` | read current environment variables |
| `--metadata` | harvest this instance's metadata credential (AWS/GCP/Azure/k8s/Alibaba/DigitalOcean/OCI) and triage it; requires `--live` (it's a network read) |
| `--browser` | model malicious-browser-extension impact: score installed Chromium-family extensions; with `--live --intrusive`, inventory the live sessions they'd reach |
| `--all` | with `--browser`, list every extension (not just the risky ones) |
| `--endpoint URL` | host/instance for self-hosted & set-shaped creds |
| `--proxy URL` | route HTTP recon via http/https/socks5 proxy |
| `--timeout DUR` | per-credential recon timeout (default `15s`) |
| `--concurrency N` | credentials reconned at once on `--live` (default `8`) |
| `--context TERMS` | comma-separated crown-jewel terms; a match raises tier |
| `--min-severity TIER` | only print findings at or above a tier (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`/`info`/`dead`); `dead` is the floor, so `info` excludes dead and `high` keeps only critical+high |
| `-o, --output FILE` | write results to FILE instead of stdout (`0600`, color off; status stays on stderr) |
| `--json` | machine-readable output (NDJSON, one note per line) |
| `--stream` | print results as found (discovery order) instead of sorted by impact |
| `--no-reverse` | keep highest-impact findings first; by default an interactive terminal reverses them to the bottom (above the summary) so the worst don't scroll off the top |
| `--only TYPES` / `--skip TYPES` | scope by module name or category (`databases`,`cloud`,`secrets`,`ai`,`vcs`,`kubernetes`,`identity`,`backup`,`endpoint`) |
| `--from-gitleaks F` / `--from-trufflehog F` | triage each finding in a scanner report |
| `--from-nuclei F` | triage each value extracted by a nuclei JSONL (`-j`) scan; `F` = `-` reads stdin (stream over a pipe) |
| `--ssh-correlate` | SSH: read local hints for candidate target hosts |
| `--trace` | print the raw request + response of each call (secrets masked) |
| `--user-agent UA` | User-Agent for recon calls (default `geiger/<version>`) |
| `--color MODE` | `auto` (default, off when piped) / `always` / `never` |
| `-v` / `-q` | show planned/executed calls (and full finding detail) / quiet stderr |
| `--version` | print version |

### Tiers

`CRITICAL` · `HIGH` · `MEDIUM` · `LOW` · `INFO` · `DEAD` — a composite blast-radius
score (capability × reach × sensitivity), relative not absolute. `--context`
matches and force-multiplier capabilities force at least `HIGH`.

### What geiger reads — and what it can't

geiger triages a credential **you were handed**, or one **sitting on disk**.

- **In scope — on-disk / offline-readable.** API tokens, connection strings,
  cloud CLI caches (`~/.aws`, gcloud, MSAL), SSH keys, kubeconfigs, secrets-manager
  creds, MCP configs, AI-IDE plaintext token stores, password-manager *recovery
  material* (KeePass, encrypted Bitwarden — offline-crackable with the master
  password), plaintext exports, and Firefox saved logins (`logins.json` +
  `key4.db`), which decrypt offline when no primary password is set.
- **Out of scope — in-process / OS-bound.** Chromium passwords & cookies (wrapped
  by DPAPI / macOS Keychain / Secret Service), raw DPAPI blobs, the macOS
  Keychain, LSASS. Reading those means decrypting against a live OS session —
  credential *extraction from a host*, not triage of one. Not always a black and white line.
  (`--browser` models the extension-capability and session-*metadata* angle — which
  domains have a live session, which extension could reach them — without decrypting
  the cookie values; see **Browser extensions** above.)

### Coverage

Recognition rides on [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)
(shape/checksum) plus geiger's own shape/env-name recognizers; an unrecognized
type is reported `unknown, not characterized`. Triage keys on capability — a
key that runs code, wipes devices, restores backups, or reads *other* secrets is
a force multiplier; a billed-usage API key is a warning.

### Output

A block per credential: a tier, a redacted title with the source location, never
the raw secret, labeled findings (`⚠` notable, `⚠⚠` force multiplier, `?`
can't-determine-read-only), and a one-line takeaway.

**For IR**, each finding leads with *where* and *when*: an `exposure` line
classifies the source — a **crash dump** (in-memory, persisted to disk, often
auto-uploaded — may have left the host), a VS Code **local-history snapshot**, an
IDE secret store, shell history, a log — and `source modified` / `validated live`
carry the file mtime and live-check timestamp. When a secret turns up in several
files, `also exposed in` groups them by class (`8 local-history snapshots; 7
crash dumps`) instead of listing paths (the full list expands under `-v` and in
`--json`).

With `-v` each planned call prints as a copy-pasteable `curl`. Triaging more than
one credential prints a closing **summary** — tier breakdown, rotate-first queue,
and follow-ups (secrets-store reach, what couldn't be characterized, anything
hidden by `--min-severity`). GitHub write/admin and org-admin are read from each
repo's `permissions` and `/user/memberships/orgs`, so they're reported even for
fine-grained PATs that expose no scopes.

**Drift resilience.** Beyond declared field paths, every response is scanned
heuristically (admin/owner indicators → force multiplier; a fallback identity +
count when the API shape changed), so a module stays useful as providers rename
fields. `--trace` shows the raw request/response (secrets masked).

## How it works

**Pipeline:** recognize → (authenticate) → recon → note. Recon runs the
identity/whoami call first, then a couple of count calls to size reach.

**Safety model**
- **Read-only by construction.** One client allows only `GET`/`HEAD` plus a short
  allowlist of read-only POSTs (STS `GetCallerIdentity`, k8s
  `SelfSubjectRulesReview`, the single OAuth token exchange). DB recon uses a
  read-only session and a fixed query allowlist. Local stores (SQLite, IDE
  `state.vscdb`, Firefox key4.db) open read-only. A guard test enforces this
  across every module.
- **Dry-run by default.** `--live` is required and always prints the destinations
  it hits (real provider APIs, and their audit logs).
- **Attribution.** Recon identifies itself as `geiger/<version>` — dual use beware, 
  no detection evasion; defenders can attribute the calls.
- **Secrets are not printed or stored.** Redacted everywhere; scrubbed from URLs,
  headers, and errors.
- **Untrusted-input hardening.** Refuses cloud-metadata targets (SSRF), sanitizes
  hostile API responses, strips file-referencing DSN options
- **Endpoint provenance.** A host read out of scanned data is untrusted: a planted
  URL would otherwise aim a real credential at whoever planted it. Every module
  declares where its credential may go, enforced centrally at recognition time —
  a SaaS module is pinned to its vendor's domains, `--endpoint` outranks anything
  in the file, and a violation degrades to "needs endpoint" instead of dialing.
  Self-hosted services can legitimately live at any domain, so those are not
  pinned; their destination is flagged in the note instead.

**Principle: likely impact, not perfect impact.** 
geiger is triage, *not* deep cloud-privesc graphing (use PMapper/CloudFox/ScoutSuite/etc for that).

**Authorized use only.** geiger exercises live credentials — run it only on creds
you are entitled to triage.

## Contributing a module

Most providers are a few lines of declarative recipe:

```go
add("digitalocean-pat", recipe.HTTP{
    ModuleName: "digitalocean", Base: "https://api.digitalocean.com",
    Auth:   recipe.AuthSpec{Kind: recipe.Bearer},
    Whoami: recipe.GET("/v2/account").Field("email", "account.email"),
    Calls:  []recipe.Call{recipe.GET("/v2/droplets").CountFrom("meta.total", "droplets")},
}.Module())
```

**If your `Base` is templated on a host — `{endpoint}`, `{host}`, `{api}`,
`{server}` — you must also declare an `Endpoint` policy.** That host comes from
the file being scanned, which an attacker may have written, so geiger needs to
know which hosts are legitimate for your service:

```go
    // SaaS-only: pin the vendor's domains (list every region and gov host).
    ModuleName: "zendesk", Endpoint: saasOnly("zendesk.com"), Base: "{endpoint}",

    // Deployable at any domain — including vendors shipping both SaaS and
    // on-prem, where pinning would break real deployments.
    ModuleName: "vault", Endpoint: selfHosted, Base: "{endpoint}",
```

Resolve the host with `resolveEndpoint` rather than reading a variable yourself:
it puts the operator's `--endpoint` ahead of anything in the file. Don't pair a
service's credential with another service's URL variable — bind each host
variable to the module it names. `TestEveryEndpointSteeredModuleDeclaresAPolicy`
fails if a module skips this.

Add an `httptest`-backed test, then `go run ./tools/coverage` to refresh the
coverage table above. Exotic signing (SigV4, RS256-JWT, Digest) implements the
`module.Module` interface directly with the `internal/sign` + `internal/auth`
helpers — see `internal/modules/` for examples.
